Spark Royalty is a royalty based freelancing market. It is a platform where
freelancers can offer their services in exchange for royalties. I built this
project with Next.js. I used Tailwind and Shadcn for styling. Supabase for my
backend. As well as tRPC and Prisma to create my API. You can check out the site
